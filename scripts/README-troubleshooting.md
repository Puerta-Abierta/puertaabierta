```
‚ùå Homepage schema not found
   Make sure you have deployed your schema with the homepage type
```

**Solutions:**

```

#### Option B: Manual Schema Deployment
1. Go to your Sanity Studio
2. Make sure your schema includes the homepage type
3. Deploy your schema from the Studio

#### Option C: Check Schema Files
Ensure your schema files are properly configured:

- `src/sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts` includes the homepage schema
- Schema is properly exported

### 2. Environment Variables Not Set

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Missing required environment variables:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID

```

#### Option B: Manual Setup
Create `.env.local` file:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

#### Option C: Test Environment
```bash
npm run test-env
```

### 3. Sanity Connection Failed

   - Go to "API" tab
   - Verify your token has "Editor" permissions

2. **Check Project ID:**

   - Check if there are any service issues

3. **Retry:**
   - Run the script again
   - Sometimes it's a temporary issue

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Complete Reset and Setup

1. **Clean Environment:**
   ```bash
   # Remove existing .env files
   rm .env.local .env
   
   # Create fresh environment
   npm run create-env
   ```

2. **Test Environment:**

   ```

3. **Deploy Schema:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-schema
   ```

   ```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by modifying the scripts:

```javascript
// Add at the top of any script
process.env.DEBUG = 'true'
console.log('Environment variables:', process.env)
```

### Manual Verification

1. **Check Sanity Studio:**
   - Go to your Sanity Studio
   - Look for "Homepage Content" document type
   - Verify schema is deployed

2. **Check API Access:**
   - Use Sanity Vision in Studio
   - Run query: `*[_type == "homepage"][0]`

3. **Check Environment:**
   - Verify `.env.local` file exists
   - Check variable values are correct
